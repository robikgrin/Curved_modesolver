# Cuved-WG-modesolver
## Overview
Photonic modesolver for curved waveguides.

- fully vectorial option with index averaging technique implementation,
- simple structure drawing,
- perfectly-meatched layer **(PML)** implementation,
- automated data saving and plotting via matplotlib.pyplot,
- overlap calculaion
## Features

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Effective indexes $n_{eff}$ dependency from a width $W$ of a core for all calculated modes
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Wavelength sweep
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Effective indexes $n_eff$ dependency from the step of simulation $\delta$
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Effective indexes $n_{eff}$ dependency from the distance to the layout edges $\Delta$
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Effective indexes $n_{eff}$ dependency from curvarure $\kappa$ values
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Mode evolution for the curvature $\kappa$ values (**gif** format)
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Any possible crossection profile calculations
